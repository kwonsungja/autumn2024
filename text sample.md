## 🍀Can I Swim?
Tom Michell is a British teacher. In the 1970s, he worked at an English language boarding school in Argentina.
One day he visited a beach and found a penguin that was injured and alone. Michell decided to help the bird.
He cleaned it, fed it, and even gave it a name—Juan Salvado. From that day on,
Juan Salvado lived on the terrace of his room in the school dormitory. 
The following is part of the story, written by Tom Michell, about the penguin and a boy at the school.
The events of that day were extraordinary.
A child had gone down to the water to swim with a penguin, and shortly afterward, a young man had emerged.
The ugly duckling had become a swan. It was definitely a turning point.
Diego’s confidence grew quickly after that day.
When the school had a swimming competition, he won every race he participated in.
The encouragement and acknowledgement given by the other boys was genuine.
He had earned the respect of his classmates.
Over the next few weeks, his grades improved and he became more popular. 
Thanks to a swim with a penguin, a lonely boy’s life was changed forever.
