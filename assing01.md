  while the students take notes key words and phrases. The learners then work in groups to try to reconstruct
  
  the text collaboratively. Students compare their reconstructed passage with the original passage.

  In here, teacher can set a gender of voice, reading rate the text.
  
* Teacher shows the syllables divided again read the text through the native speaker.

* Teacher demonstrates parts of speech in the text.
 
* Uses line focus in order to stress the sentence reading now.

* Later teacher shows the translation in Korean.
